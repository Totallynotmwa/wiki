Welcome to the guide for Gaming in CachyOS. We'll guide you through the essentials aspects on how to setup everything and have a great experience.

## Prerequisites

:::caution
Before we dive into the fun stuff, it’s essential to ensure that your graphics card drivers are installed and functioning correctly. If your graphics card isn’t performing optimally, you may encounter issues when playing games.
:::

### Essential Packages

To make things easier for you, CachyOS has grouped all the necessary packages for gaming into one meta package that includes all the known stores and extras for gaming in Linux. This makes the installation and setup process for gaming faster and less convoluted for everyone.

```sh title='Run the following command in a terminal'
sudo pacman -S cachyos-gaming-meta
```

:::note
The `cachyos-gaming-meta` package installs all the important libraries, packages, plugins and stores such as Steam, Lutris and some tools which are necessary for most games to run and work properly. Check out the [package list](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-PKGBUILDS/blob/master/cachyos-gaming-meta/PKGBUILD#L10) for more information on what is installing.

*If you find that any packages are missing, feel free to let the CachyOS team know.*

## Steam

For Steam users, playing games on CachyOS is a breeze!. Open Steam and follow the [Proton guide](/configuration/gaming#how-to-enable-proton-support-in-steam) and you're ready to enjoy your games.

:::note
Laptop users with discrete NVIDIA GPUs should refer to the following [guide](https://wiki.cachyos.org/configuration/dual_gpu/)

:::tip
CachyOS provides various Proton versions that we build & maintain for further performance improvements:
- `proton-cachyos` `(included in the cachyos-gaming-meta package)` being the one that we develop with added QoL changes + cherry picked patches + compilation optimizations `(x86-64-v3 & x86-64-v4)`
- `proton-ge-custom`, `proton-tkg-git`, `proton-experimental` and `proton stable releases` are built against native libs.
- `proton-ge-custom-bin` pulled from AUR.

To check if your game is compatible or how does it run with Linux, visit [proton-db](https://www.protondb.com/) or [Areweanticheatyet (For Online Games and Online games not on steam)](areweanticheatyet.com).

## Steam FAQ & Tips

### Which Proton version should i use in Steam?

- [`proton-cachyos`](https://github.com/CachyOS/proton-cachyos) Being the one that we build and maintain is highly recommended unless it has an issue with the game you want to play. Should work in most cases.
- `Proton Experimental` Bleeding edge release from `Valve` If the game you want to play is relatively new or it doesn't work well with the current Proton stable release or perhaps you saw people recommending it in [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/).
- `Proton 9.0.3 or lower` Stable releases from `Valve`. If the game you want to play only works in a previous Proton release.
- `Proton-GE` Build made by [GloriousEggroll](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom) in some cases it comes in handy.

### What is proton-cachyos?

Check out this [explanation about it.](/configuration/gaming#proton-cachyos)

### How to properly combine multiple launch options

- Add the environment variables or commands you want and at the end include a `%command%`
    - Example: `__GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_SKIP_CLEANUP=1 prime-run game-performance %command%`

:::caution
Don't add multiple `%command%` by using them as separators for multiple launch options.

Example: `__GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_SKIP_CLEANUP=1 %command% game-performance %command% prime-run %command%`
    - On this case, everything after the first `%command%` is going to be ignored because it's being treated as game arguments therefore only `__GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_SKIP_CLEANUP=1` got recognized as a launch option.
:::

## Performance tips

### Power Profile Switching on Demand

:::note
This behavior is slightly different with `intel_pstate`. On Intel, the governor remains at powersave but the
EPP/EPB values are set to performance.
:::

CachyOS provides a wrapper script [`game-performance`](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-Settings/blob/master/usr/bin/game-performance)
which uses `power-profiles-daemon` to temporarily switch the current power profile to `performance`.
The `performance` profile increases the system power levels and changes the CPU governor to `performance`.

When this script is used to run a game, the system will be set to use the `performance` profile as long as the game is running.
The previously used power profile will be restored once the game is closed.

*[Feral's GameMode](https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode)
has similar a behavior but it should not be used as CachyOS already ships with [`ananicy-cpp`](https://gitlab.com/ananicy-cpp/ananicy-cpp)*

## Proton-CachyOS

Proton-CachyOS is based on the `proton-bleeding-edge branch` and applies a number of patches and changes on top of it.
- **Wine-staging patches**
- **Wine Fullscreen FSR**
- **Reflex support for Wine**
- **Support for umu-launcher**

*In addition, proton-cachyos is compiled against native system libraries and compiler instructions which can further improve performance.*

## Wine-CachyOS

This is a solution similar to proton-cachyos, but as standalone version, which can be used by Lutris, Heroic, Bottles and others.

:::note
Although it can be used as a systemd wide Wine for Desktop Applications, be aware that it might lead to some unexpected behaviors & issues due to being more gaming focused with the patches and changes.
:::

- **Based on Valve's bleeding-edge Wine**
- **Adds early hotfixes/workarounds for games**
- **protonfixes**
- **Support for `umu-launcher`**

**QoL Modifications**

- `WINE_WMCLASS:` env variable to set the wm class of all wine windows, allowing the wm to control the window through rules.
- `WINEUSERSANDBOX:` env variable to disable creating symlinks from Wine folders such as Documents/Pictures etc, to the equivalent folders in the user's directory
- `Disabled Native Window Decorations`
- `Changes for optimizing Wine's performance similar as we do with proton-cachyos`

## Bottles

Bottles is an application that allows you to easily manage Windows prefixes on your favorite Linux distributions.

Bottles can also make use of different runners like Lutris and are all manageable within the application. Bottles offers the option of a gaming-oriented prefix.

You can also install dependencies, add EXE files, and use their one-click installers for gaming-related apps like EA App or Battle.net.

```sh title="How to install Bottles"
# Open a terminal and run the following command:
sudo pacman -S bottles
```

*If you want to know more about it, check out their [documentation](https://docs.usebottles.com/).*

## Lutris Introduction & Tips

Lutris serves as a central hub for all your games on CachyOS.
 
With Lutris, you can efficiently manage your game runners, including Wine, Proton, and emulators.

- **You can launch games through Lutris simply by clicking the `Play button`.**
- **Add any game you want clicking the `+` sign in the top left.**
- **Set up a store in the `Sources` at the left panel and connecting your account, it will then proceed to install said store and then you'll be able to run games from within the store, just like you do on Windows.**
- **And more!**

### Games stores supported in Lutris

- [EA App](https://lutris.net/games/ea-app/)
- [Epic Games Store](https://lutris.net/games/epic-games-store/)
- [GOG Galaxy](https://lutris.net/games/gog-galaxy/)
- [Steam](https://lutris.net/games/steam/)
- [Ubisoft Connect](https://lutris.net/games/ubisoft-connect/)
